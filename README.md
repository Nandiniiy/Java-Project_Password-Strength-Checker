This Java-based application evaluates password complexity, ensuring the security of user accounts by analyzing factors like length, character types, and common password usage patterns.
Key Features:
1) Password Evaluation - Our password evaluation feature thoroughly assesses the strength of user passwords by examining a variety of factors.
    This includes analyzing the length of the password, the types of characters used (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and checking if the password is commonly used or found in password dictionaries.
    By considering these elements, the application can accurately determine the overall strength and potential vulnerabilities of the password.
2) Vulnerability Assessment - In addition to evaluating the password itself, our application also integrates with the Pwned Passwords database maintained by the cybersecurity researcher Troy Hunt.
   This allows us to check if the user's password has been exposed in any known data breaches or password leaks.
    By cross-referencing the user's password against this extensive database, we can provide them with valuable information about whether their password has been compromised and if it should be changed immediately.
3) Security Recommendations - Based on the results of the password evaluation and vulnerability assessment, our application then provides personalized feedback and suggestions to the user. This includes recommending ways to strengthen the password, such as increasing its length, using a greater variety of characters, or avoiding common password patterns.
    By giving users tailored guidance, we empower them to create stronger, more secure passwords that better protect their accounts and personal information.

Vulnerability Assessment:
1) Pwned Passwords API : The application integrates with the Pwned Passwords API to check if the user's password has been exposed in data breaches.
2) Comprehensive Analysis : The application examines the password for common weaknesses, such as dictionary words, sequential characters, and repeated patterns.
3) Real-Time Feedback : Users receive immediate feedback on the strength of their password and are provided with suggestions for improvement.
4) Enhanced Security : By identifying and addressing password vulnerabilities, the application helps users create stronger, more secure passwords.


Leveraging Java for Secure Password Management:
1) Object-Oriented Design : The application is built upon Java's robust object-oriented programming principles, ensuring modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
2) Advanced String Handling : The application utilizes Java's powerful string manipulation capabilities to thoroughly analyze password composition and complexity.
3) Seamless API Integration : The application seamlessly integrates with the Pwned Passwords API, leveraging Java's versatile networking features to enhance password security.
